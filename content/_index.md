Hello,

Welcome to my blog. This is a captain's log, recording the results and learnings of my various (usually software-related) projects. Admittedly, this is a brand new effort, a foray into making an online presence. Beyond the obvious benefit of potentially engaging with a wider community, I hope the act of summarizing my projects and distilling them into a (hopefully) coherent series of documents will focus my efforts, improve the quality of results, and help me to learn more. Perhaps you will get something out of it, too. Anyway, that's the intro.

Ciao!
