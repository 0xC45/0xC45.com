Hello,

Welcome to my blog. This is a captain's log / lab notebook, recording the results and learnings of various (usually software-related) projects. Beyond the obvious benefit of engaging with a wider community, I hope the act of summarizing my projects and distilling them into a (hopefully) coherent series of documents will focus my efforts, improve the quality of results, and help me to remember stuff. Perhaps you will get something out of it, too. Anyway, that's the intro.

Ciao!
