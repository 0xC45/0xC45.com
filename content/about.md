My name is Jason. In my free time, I like to tinker around with technology, read books, practice cooking, and be outside. As a general principle, I strive to always be learning new things. Currently, I work as a software developer. Here are some other places that you might find me on the internet:

* [Github](https://github.com/0xC45)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/0xC45_)

If you would like to get in contact, please [send me an email](mailto:jason@0xC45.com).
